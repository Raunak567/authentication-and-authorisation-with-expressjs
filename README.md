# Assessing the Requirement: Delete User Functionality After Authentication

<h2 align=center>Understanding Authentication and Authorization</h2>
<hr/>

<h4>Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. It involves confirming that the user is who they claim to be. This typically involves checking credentials like usernames and passwords or using other methods like two-factor authentication.</h4>
<h4>Authorization is the process of determining what a user is permitted to do within a system. It involves granting or denying access to specific resources or actions based on the user's role, permissions, or privileges.</h4>

<h2 align = center>Evaluating the Requirement: Delete User Functionality After Authentication</h2>

Yes, it is generally a good idea to require authentication before allowing a user to delete their account. Here's why:

- Security: By requiring authentication, you ensure that only the legitimate user can initiate the deletion process. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive user data.
- Accountability: Authentication provides a record of who initiated the deletion, making it easier to track and investigate if necessary.
- User Protection: Requiring authentication can help protect users from accidental or unintentional deletions. It gives them a chance to reconsider their decision or seek assistance if needed.

- Delete User Functionality: To ensure the security and integrity of user data, we require authentication before allowing users to delete their accounts. This means that users must log in using their valid credentials to initiate the deletion process.

By implementing this measure, we aim to:

- Prevent unauthorized deletions: Only the legitimate user can initiate the deletion process, protecting their data from unauthorized access.
- Maintain accountability: Authentication provides a record of who deleted the account, aiding in tracking and investigation if necessary.
- Safeguard users: Requiring authentication can help prevent accidental or unintentional deletions, giving users a chance to reconsider their decision.
### Note: While authentication is a crucial step, it's also important to consider additional security measures, such as providing a confirmation prompt or offering a recovery option, to further protect users and prevent irreversible actions.
